## 1. Introduction
Nerdwork+ is a **comic-first community SaaS platform** enriched with Web 3 features (crypto payments, NFTs) and a closed-loop in-app currency called **Nerdwork Token (NWT)**. It is engineered as a **cloud-native microservices system** able to serve ~10 k concurrent users cost-effectively while maintaining a clear path to further scale.

This document unifies the previously separate PDFs‚Äî*Product Overview*, *Platform Architecture*, and *Integrating NWT*‚Äîinto one living reference for developers. Additions and pull requests are welcome via GitHub.

## 2. Product Overview
### 2.1 Vision & Value
* **Engaging creator economy** ‚Äì readers discover comics, tip creators, and unlock premium arcs.
* **Gamified learning & community** ‚Äì loyalty quests, badges, and XP keep users returning.
* **Web 3‚Äìpowered ownership** ‚Äì collectible NFT drops and on-chain proof of fandom.

### 2.2 Key Functional Pillars
| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Content** | Upload, curate, and read comics (pages served from S3 + CloudFront). |
| **Community** | Comments, follows, notifications, and messaging. |
| **Monetization** | NWT purchases (fiat/crypto via Helio), in-app spends, tipping, creator payouts. |
| **Rewards** | Automated NWT grants through Loyalty microservice (Verxio). |
| **Collectibles** | NFT minting & gating via Magicblock + IPFS (Pinata). |

---

## 3. Technology Stack
### 3.1 Languages & Frameworks
* **Frontend:** React (Next 13), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js (18 LTS), Express/Fastify for lightweight services
* **Smart-Contract / Web3:** Solidity (EVM), Rust (Solana) ‚Äì abstracted by Helio & Magicblock SDKs
### 3.2 Cloud & Data
| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Compute** | AWS ECS Fargate & Lambda | Container + serverless mix for cost/scale. |
| **API Edge** | Amazon API Gateway | Unified entry, auth, throttling. |
| **Databases** | Aurora (Postgres) ‚Ä¢ DynamoDB ‚Ä¢ QLDB (ledger) | Relational, key-value, and immutable ledger patterns. |
| **Object Storage** | Amazon S3 | Durable comic images & NFT media. |
| **CDN** | CloudFront + AWS Shield | Global latency + DDoS mitigation. |
| **Cache** | ElastiCache (Redis) | Optional hot data layer. |
| **Queue / Bus** | Amazon SQS + EventBridge | Async events, decoupling. |
| **Email** | AWS SES | Transactional & marketing mail. |

Third-party SaaS: **Helio** (crypto/fiat on-ramp), **Verxio** (loyalty XP), **Pinata** (IPFS), **Magicblock** (NFT mint).

## 4. Platform Architecture <a id="4-platform-architecture"></a>
### 4.1 High-Level Diagram
```
User‚ÜíCloudFront‚ÜíAPI Gateway‚Üí‚î¨‚îÄAuth Svc
                           ‚îú‚îÄUser Svc
                           ‚îú‚îÄComic Svc
                           ‚îú‚îÄWallet Svc
                           ‚îú‚îÄPayment Svc‚ÜíHelio
                           ‚îú‚îÄLoyalty Svc‚ÜíVerxio
                           ‚îú‚îÄNFT Svc‚ÜíMagicblock
                           ‚îú‚îÄNotification Svc‚ÜíSES
                           ‚îî‚îÄAnalytics Svc
                ‚Üò EventBridge bus + SQS queues for async workflows
```
All services are **stateless**; each owns its data store. Internal calls prefer **events over REST** to minimise coupling.

### 4.2 Scaling Targets
* **0‚Äì10 k active users** ‚Üí 1√ó r5.large Aurora, on-demand DynamoDB, capping Fargate tasks at min = 1, max = 3 per service.
* Above this tier, migrate heavy read traffic to **read replicas** and introduce **gRPC** internal mesh.

---

## 5. Nerdwork Token (NWT) Economy
### 5.1 Token Properties
* Closed-loop, **non-withdrawable** in-app currency (avoids money-transmitter laws).
* Fixed-point accounting (1 NWT = 100 cents).

### 5.2 Ledger & Wallet Service
* **Double-entry ledger** stored in QLDB (immutable) with DynamoDB shadow table for fast history queries.
* APIs: `POST /wallet/credit`, `POST /wallet/debit`, `POST /wallet/transfer`.
* Idempotency via `X-Idempotency-Key` header.

### 5.3 Token Lifecycle
| Stage | Service | Flow |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Mint** | Payment Svc ‚Üî Helio | Fiat/crypto purchase Webhook ‚Üí Wallet.credit. |
| **Earn** | Loyalty Svc | Event (UserDidX) ‚Üí reward ‚Üí Wallet.credit. |
| **Spend** | Comic/NFT/Tip flows via Payment Svc | Wallet.debit (buyer) & Wallet.credit (creator/platform). |
| **Sink** | Platform fees or burn account | Configurable governance lever. |

### 5.4 Anti-Fraud & Governance
* Rate-limit purchases, monitor large transfers.
* Admin dashboard to freeze wallets, adjust supply.
* Clear **Terms & Conditions**: ‚ÄúNWT is a limited license, not legal tender.‚Äù
